# Snake Game with Pathfinding

This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game that uses DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms for pathfinding.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay
- Pathfinding using DFS/BFS algorithms
- Score tracking
- Game over detection

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls
- Arrow keys to control the snake
- Space to pause/resume
- ESC to quit

## Implementation Details
The game uses:
- Pygame for graphics and game loop
- DFS/BFS algorithms for pathfinding
- Numpy for efficient array operations
